# SolanaCrowd
A decentralized crowdfunding platform built on the Solana blockchain using Rust and the Anchor framework.  
This project is developed as a **final year academic project** and focuses on understanding on-chain crowdfunding mechanisms using modern Web3 tools.
The platform allows users to create crowdfunding campaigns and contribute SOL securely through Solana smart contracts.
---
## 🚀 Features
- Create crowdfunding campaigns with a defined funding goal
- Contribute SOL to active campaigns
- Track total funds raised per campaign
- Secure handling of funds using PDA-based Solana smart contracts
- Smart contracts tested using the Anchor test suite
